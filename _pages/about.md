**Final year Masters student at the Institute for Astrophysics, University of Vienna**

After growing up in the midst of the dolomites I moved to Vienna to study astrophysics where I discovered my love for galactic archeology. My current research objective is to use machine learning, statistics and visualisation tools to study local star formation and stellar clusters, using the phenomenal *Gaia* mission that collected information on more than 1.6 billion stars in our Milky Way. I am passionate about making academia and astro in particular more accessible and inclusive, because diversity in all aspects drives excellence in science!
